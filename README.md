# 8086-Emulator
A program that immitates a 8086 CPU

This program allows you to load binary code and data into its memory and let a virtual 8086 CPU execute it. There are several options that allow the examining and modifying of the CPU's status and memory. By default there is no BIOS, OS or simulated hardware. In case I/O or interrupts occur the program stops executing to allow you to enter input. This allows whatever program is being executed to think there actually is hardware present. There also is a quick reference for supported commands and a disassembler. And let us not forget the ability to put commands in a script, one of which can be specified as a commandline argument and is executed when the program is started.
