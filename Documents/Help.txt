[Segment:Offset]              Displays the specified memory location contents as a byte, word, and first two bytes as characters.
[Segment:Offset] = Value      Writes the specified byte/word/character to the specified memory address.
[Segment:Offset] = {values}   Writes the specified values of any supported type (except strings) to the specified memory address.
[Segment:Offset] = "String"   Writes the specified string to the specified memory address.
Register                      Displays the specified register's value.
Register = Value              Set the specified register to the specified byte/word.
C                             Clears the output window.
E                             Causes the emulated CPU to start executing code.
L [Path]                      Loads a file into the emulated memory at CS:IP.
M [Offset:Segment] [Count]    Display memory starting at CS:IP.
MA [Offset:Segment]           Allows the user to enter assembly instructions.
MD [Offset:Segment] [Count]   Disassemble memory starting at CS:IP.
MT [Offset:Segment] [Count]   Display memory starting at CS:IP.
                              Byte values 0x20-0x7E are shown as characters.
Q                             Quits the emulator.
R                             Display all registers and their values.
S                             Causes the emulated CPU to stop executing code.
SCR                           Displays the screen output.
ST                            Displays all word values from SS:SP to SS:FFFF.
T                             Executes and displays a single instruction.
TE                            Executes and displays instructions.
TS                            Stops executing and displaying instructions.

Notes:
-If no path is specified for a command a dialog is displayed.
-Values for registers, memory locations, segments, offsets and counts can be:
 -Hexadecimal numeric literals.
 -Memory locations enclosed in square brackets. 
 -Registers.
 -Single characters.
 -Strings - for memory locations only.
-The commandline can be used to specify a script that is executed at start up.
-All script files must have the following text as their first line (no preceding blank lines allowed): "[SCRIPT]".
-The F3 key recalls the most recently given command.
