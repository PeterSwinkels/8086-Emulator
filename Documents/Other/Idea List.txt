Ideas for things to be implemented/changed in the 8086 Emulator.

1. OF and SF flags are improperly set by CMP causing issues with instructions such as JG!
2. Add CGA character drawing. XOR on bit 7.
3. Add VGA character drawing.
4. EscapeByte and GetFlatCSIP can be converted to a single line procedure.
5. INT 21h, 41h - Delete file.
6. INT 21h, 42h - Move file pointer.
